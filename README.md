# rlnc
Random Linear Network Coding

## Introduction
`rlnc` is a Rust library crate that implements Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) over $GF(2^8)$ with primitive polynomial $x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 1$. This library provides functionalities for erasure-coding data, reconstructing original data from coded pieces, and recoding existing coded pieces to new erasure-coded pieces, without ever decoding it back to original data.

For a quick understanding of RLNC, have a look at my blog post @ https://itzmeanjan.in/pages/rlnc-in-depth.html.

Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) excels in highly dynamic and lossy environments like multicast, peer-to-peer networks, and distributed storage, due to interesting properties such as encoding with random-sampled coefficients, any `k` out of `n` coded-pieces are sufficient to recover and recoding new pieces with existing erasure-coded pieces. Unlike Reed-Solomon, which requires specific symbols for deterministic recovery, RLNC allows decoding from *any* set of linearly independent packets. Compared to Fountain Codes, RLNC offers robust algebraic linearity with coding vector overhead, whereas Fountain codes prioritize very low decoding complexity and indefinite symbol generation, often for large-scale broadcasts.

## Features
For now this crate implements only **Full RLNC** scheme.

- **Encoder**: Splits original data into fixed-size pieces and generates new coded pieces by linearly combining these original pieces with random coefficients, sampled from $GF(2^8)$.
- **Decoder**: Receives coded pieces, applies Gaussian elimination to recover the original data, and handles linearly dependent pieces gracefully.
- **Recoder**: Takes already coded pieces and generates new coded pieces from them, facilitating multi-hop data distribution without requiring intermediate decoding.
- **Error Handling**: Defines a custom `RLNCError` enum to provide clear error messages for various operational failures.

## Prerequisites
Rust stable toolchain; see https://rustup.rs for installation guide. MSRV for this crate is 1.85.0.

 ```bash
# While developing this library, I was using
$ rustc --version
rustc 1.88.0 (6b00bc388 2025-06-23)
```

## Testing
For ensuring functional correctness of RLNC operations, the library includes a comprehensive test suite. Run all the tests by running following commands.

```bash
# Testing on host, first with `default` feature, then with `parallel` feature enabled.
make test

# Testing on web assembly target, using `wasmtime`.
rustup target add wasm32-wasip1
cargo install wasmtime-cli --locked
make test-wasm
```

### Code Coverage
To generate a detailed code coverage report in HTML format, use [cargo-tarpaulin](https://github.com/xd009642/tarpaulin):

```bash
# Install cargo-tarpaulin if not already installed
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
make coverage
```

```bash

> [!NOTE]
> There is a help menu, which introduces you to all available commands; just run `$ make` from the root directory of this project.

## Benchmarking
Performance benchmarks for several input configurations are included to evaluate the efficiency of this RLNC implementation.

To run the benchmarks, execute the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
make bench # First with `default` feature, then with `parallel` feature enabled.
```

> [!WARNING]
> When benchmarking make sure you've disabled CPU frequency scaling, otherwise numbers you see can be misleading. I find https://github.com/google/benchmark/blob/b40db869/docs/reducing_variance.md helpful.

### On 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1260P

Running benchmarks on `Linux 6.14.0-27-generic x86_64`, compiled with `rustc 1.88.0 (6b00bc388 2025-06-23)`.

Component | Peak Median Throughput (`default` feature) | Peak Median Throughput (`parallel` feature) | Impact of number of pieces on performance
--- | --- | --- | ---
Full RLNC Encoder | **30.14 GiB/s** | **23.39 GiB/s** | The number of pieces original data got split into has a **minimal** impact on the encoding speed.
Full RLNC Recoder | **27.26 GiB/s** | **12.63 GiB/s** | Similar to the encoder, the recoder's performance remains largely consistent regardless of how many pieces the original data is split into.
Full RLNC Decoder | **1.59 GiB/s** | **Doesn't yet implement a parallel decoding mode** | As the number of pieces increases, the decoding time increases substantially, leading to a considerable drop in throughput. This indicates that decoding is the most computationally intensive part of the full RLNC scheme, and its performance is inversely proportional to the number of pieces.

In summary, the full RLNC implementation demonstrates excellent encoding and recoding speeds, consistently achieving GiB/s throughputs with minimal sensitivity to the number of data pieces. The `parallel` feature, leveraging Rust `rayon` data-parallelism framework, also provides good performance for both encoding and recoding. Whether you want to use that feature, completely depends on your usecase. However, decoding remains a much slower operation, with its performance significantly diminishing as the data is split into a greater number of pieces, and currently does **not** implement a parallel decoding algorithm.

## Usage

To use `rlnc` library crate in your Rust project, add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rlnc = "=0.8.1"                                      # On x86 target, it offers AVX2 and SSSE3 optimization for fast encoding, recoding and decoding.
# or
rlnc = { version = "=0.8.1", features = "parallel" } # Uses `rayon`-based data-parallelism for fast encoding and recoding. Prefer it over `default` if input blob gets split into *substantially* large many chunks. Note, this feature, doesn't yet parallelize RLNC decoding.

rand = { version = "=0.9.1" } # Required for random number generation
```

### Full RLNC Workflow Example

I maintain an example demonstrating the Full RLNC workflow:

- Encoding original data into coded pieces.
- Recoding to generate new pieces from received coded pieces. It simulates a relay node.
- Finally decoding all received pieces to recover the original data.

> [!NOTE]
> New recoded pieces could be either useful or not for the Decoder, based on Recoder input coded pieces i.e. from which they are recoded and whether they have already been seen by Decoder or not.

See [full_rlnc.rs](./examples/full_rlnc.rs) example program. Run the program with `$ make example`.

```bash
Initialized Encoder with 10240 bytes of data, split into 32 pieces, each of 321 bytes. Each coded piece will be of 353 bytes.
Initializing Decoder, expecting 32 original pieces of 321 bytes each.
